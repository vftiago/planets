I made up `scale_rel_to_star` (based on the gas giant ring's `scale_rel_to_planet`) because I couldn't figure out how to make the blob layer larger than the star itself without modifying the existing shader. I couldn't understand how this achieved in the original Godot project so far.

Not really a big deal because I'm not a big fan of this blob layer anyway and will probably end up not using it at all. At the very least it needs a lot of tweaking in order to look good.
